* Test
** ENH: make bse.py operate on niftis
 - then FsInDwi doens't need to convert to nrrd first as well as fs2dwi.py
** add antsJointFusion
** move atlas.py root flags to subcommands (otherwise help doesn't work)
* Todo
** handle empty caselist in readparams.py
** missing caselist: make more descriptive
** missing params file: change exception to log message
** STY: rename extra_words/be specific on what it does
** STY: static_build -> build
** ENH: add validators to pipeline (e.g. dwi validator/nrrdchecker)
** ENH: add permutation check to bse.py (currently assumes correct dwi permutation)
** ENH: add check for correct DWI axes permutation
** STY: software: if building  master, don't say building '...-master'
