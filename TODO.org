# Check by Ryan Ekbo:

** Add tests

** ENH: 
* make bse.py and fs2dwi.py operate on niftis, then FsInDwi doesn't need to convert to nrrd first 
* handle empty caselist in readparams.py
* missing caselist: make more descriptive
* missing params file: change exception to log message
* add validators to pipeline (e.g. dwi validator/nrrdchecker)
* add permutation check to bse.py (currently assumes correct dwi permutation)

** STY: 
* static_build -> build
* if building  master, don't say building '...-master'

# Check by Tashrif Billah:

** ENH: 
* make all unu dice along gradient axis, join accordingly:
check antsApplyTransformsDWI.py and eddy.py
Tashrif has codes for it in pnlbwh/conversion/bval_bvec_io.nrrd_bvals_bvecs

* eddy.py assumes only lps or ras for the input DWI which may not be true
Tashrif has codes for it in pnlbwh/conversion/nifti_write.py

* fs2dwi.py does not handle 'through T2' case, Tashrif has codes for it in nifti pipeline

** BUG:
Make the following change in Cmake file 
https://github.com/pnlbwh/pnlpipe/commit/12130cdfbe8005338d3bd961949fd635f2730f92
