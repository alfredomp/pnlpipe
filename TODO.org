# Check by Ryan Ekbo:

** Add tests

** ENH: 
* make bse.py and fs2dwi.py operate on niftis, then FsInDwi doesn't need to convert to nrrd first 
* handle empty caselist in readparams.py
* missing caselist: make more descriptive
* missing params file: change exception to log message
* add validators to pipeline (e.g. dwi validator/nrrdchecker)
* add permutation check to bse.py (currently assumes correct dwi permutation)

** STY: 
* static_build -> build
* if building  master, don't say building '...-master'

# Check by Tashrif Billah:

** ENH: 
* make all unu dice along gradient axis, join accordingly:
check antsApplyTransformsDWI.py and eddy.py
Tashrif has codes for it in pnlbwh/conversion/bval_bvec_io.nrrd_bvals_bvecs

* eddy.py assumes only lps or ras for the input DWI which may not be true
Tashrif has codes for it in pnlbwh/conversion/nifti_write.py

* fs2dwi.py does not handle 'through T2' case, Tashrif has codes for it in nifti pipeline

* if there is an error about a missing antsRegistration script, copy the script 
from ./pnlpipe/soft_dir/BRAINSTools-build/ANTs/Scripts to ./pnlpipe/soft_dir/BRAINSTools-bin-95ac1e28
Alternatively, you can also do export PATH=$PATH:./pnlpipe/soft_dir/BRAINSTools-build/ANTs/Scripts

** BUG:
* DwiEpiMask-*.nrrd header has gradients in it since it is not a bet mask rather a 
manually binarized mask over epi corrected DWI. See pnlpipe_pipelines/_pnl.py:class DwiEpiMask(NrrdOutput)
* conversion to int16 in `epi.py` should be removed
