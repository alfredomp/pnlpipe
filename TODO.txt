# Checks by Ryan Ekbo:

## Add tests

## ENH:
* make bse.py and fs2dwi.py operate on niftis, then FsInDwi doesn't need to convert to nrrd first 
* handle empty caselist in readparams.py
* missing caselist: make more descriptive
* missing params file: change exception to log message
* add validators to pipeline (e.g. dwi validator/nrrdchecker)
* add permutation check to bse.py (currently assumes correct dwi permutation)

## STY:
* static_build -> build
* if building  master, don't say building '...-master'

# Checks by Tashrif Billah:

## ENH:
* make all unu dice along gradient axis, join accordingly:
see antsApplyTransformsDWI.py and eddy.py
Tashrif has codes for it in pnlbwh/conversion/bval_bvec_io.nrrd_bvals_bvecs

* eddy.py assumes only lps or ras for the input DWI which may not be true
Tashrif has codes for it in pnlbwh/conversion/nifti_write.py

## BUG:
* DwiEpiMask-*.nrrd header has gradients in it since it is not a bet mask rather a
manually binarized mask over epi corrected DWI. See pnlpipe_pipelines/_pnl.py:class DwiEpiMask(NrrdOutput)

* conversion to int16 in `epi.py` should be removed
